                We offer some forest walks, with donation stands along some points along our paths,<br> 
                and are opertunities for visitors to help support the local community and charitys in the area.<br>
                One of our walks takes you past a hidden pond, a favourite spot for our ducks,<br>
                that often take shelter in the reeds when its gets windy, which does make them harder to spot,<br>
                but will always make an effort to come out when encouraged by the promise of food.<br>
                So we kindly provide seeds that can be found at the donation stands if you wish to feed the ducks.<br>

                One of our more popular walks comes into its own as autumn comes into full swing.<br>
                As all of the leaves start to turn, deep red, and brown, and there is a nice crunch under foot.<br>
                With a peacful river flowing alongside, with occationaly a duck or two.
